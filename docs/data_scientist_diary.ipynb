    "## 1) Initial Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem.** Classify movie reviews as positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative objective.** Exceed **70%** in the main metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses.**\n",
    "- **H1.** A \"mini-transformer\" in Keras with integrated vectorization will be sufficient for >70% on IMDB.\n",
    "- **H2.** Lightweight text normalization (lowercase, noise and emoji cleanup) improves stability without requiring aggressive cleaning.\n",
    "- **H3.** With stratified partitions and *early stopping*, simple validation + *bootstrap* on test provides sufficient evidence without exhaustive CV.\n",

    "## 2) Stage-by-Stage Diary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 1 — Dataset Selection and Scope\n",
    "I chose **IMDB 50K Movie Reviews** for its size, clear format, and abundant literature.  \n",
    "I discarded **Sentiment140** and **TweetEval** because they were too large and thus increased training time.  \n",
    "I defined the technical approach: **\"mini-transformer\"** with Keras and **70%** as the minimum target in main metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 2 — EDA and Preparation\n",
    "I performed a quick inspection:  \n",
    "- Typical noise (HTML, tags, symbols) -> basic filtering.  \n",
    "- Emojis and unicode: low frequency; I added handling later in the *standardize* function of `TextVectorization`.  \n",
    "- Long and colloquial reviews; I confirmed the need for truncation via `seq_len`.  \n",
    "I left for later: length analysis by class and exhaustive vocabulary (not critical for the MVP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 3 — Partitioning and Experimental Protocol\n",
    "I applied **train / valid / test** with **stratification**. The **test** set was completely withheld until the end to avoid *leakage*.  \n",
    "I explored `KerasClassifier` *wrappers* (scikeras) + `StratifiedKFold` with *multi-metrics*, but **changed plans**: **exhaustive CV was abandoned** due to cost/benefit; I switched to **internal stratified validation** during tuning and **bootstrap on test** to estimate uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 4 — Text Engineering and Model\n",
    "I integrated `TextVectorization` into the model graph itself to accept raw text during inference.  \n",
    "I adjusted *standardize* for emojis/unicode and fixed `vocab_size` based on pilot counts.  \n",
    "Final architecture: **mini-transformer** with *embedding*, lightweight attention block, and *feed-forward*; decision threshold (`threshold`) configurable from the *config*.  \n",
    "**Training operational adjustment:** I set **epochs = 3** and **seq_len = 256** for more reasonable training times. Consistent with this, **I removed the *callbacks*** *EarlyStopping* and *ReduceLROnPlateau* (they had **patience** 2 and 1, with little utility over so few *epochs*). The performance target and training stability were maintained.  \n",
    "Tracked metrics: F1 / ROC-AUC / Accuracy as needed; the **>70%** target was met.  \n",
    "Incidents: an **OOV** calculation path became very slow after varying `seq_len`; it stabilized after reviewing the pipeline and sequence limits. This happened mainly when the **OUT_OF_RANGE: End of sequence** associated with `TextVectorization` did not appear; it was resolved after adjusting some configuration values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 5 — Cleanup, Configuration, and *Hardening*\n",
    "I reorganized the **configuration** to reflect the abandonment of CV; I added `threshold` and `prediction_confidence`.  \n",
    "I tidied up the code with **type hints**, **docstrings**, and **markdowns**; I cleaned up `requirements.txt` from packages that were not ultimately used.  \n",
    "I unified all project text to **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 6 — Minimum Viable Product and Deployment\n",
    "I trained the **final model** with all training data and saved it in `SavedModel` format;  \n",
    "I exposed the model via **REST API** and **dockerized** it; I cleaned up code comments and added the `prediction_confidence` function to the API.\n",
    "Finally, I polished the project documentation, the READMEs, and the work diary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) Results and Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative objective:** exceeded **70%** in main metrics.  \n",
    "- **Behavior:** lightweight normalization + `TextVectorization` in the graph simplifies *serving* and maintains performance.  \n",
    "- **Efficiency:** with **epochs = 3** and **seq_len = 256**, **more reasonable training times** were obtained without degrading the minimum target.  \n",
    "- **Robustness:** *bootstrap* on the test set for uncertainty bands with controlled computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4) Key Decisions (and Why)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IMDB 50K over Twitter datasets.** Less platform noise and lower data volume for better training time.  \n",
    "2. **No exhaustive CV.** High cost and low marginal gain; replaced by internal stratified validation and bootstrap on test.\n",
    "3. **Lightweight normalization.** Sufficient for the objective without complicating the pipeline.\"\n"
